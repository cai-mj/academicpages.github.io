Hi! I'm Minjie, an assistant professor at [Hunan University](http://www-en.hnu.edu.cn/index.htm) and a cooperative research fellow at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) cooperating with [Prof. Yoichi Sato](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ysato/index.html). My research interests include computer vision, human-machine interactions, and robotics.

I received my Ph.D. in Information Science and Technology at [The University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), supervised by Prof. Yoichi Sato and co-advised by [Dr. Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/).
