Hi! I'm Minjie, a post-doctoral researcher at [Institute of Industrial Science](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at the University of Tokyo. 

I received my Ph.D from Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), my M.A. in Communication and Information Engineering and B.A. in Electronics and Information Engineering at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).

Note: I have just started to setup my homepage in Github. The content is under update...
