Hi! I'm Minjie, a post-doctoral researcher at [Institute of Industrial Science](https://www.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at the University of Tokyo. I am now working with [Prof. Yoichi Sato](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~ysato/index.html) under the [JST CREST](http://www.hci.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~cvs/) project, which focuses on understanding and assistance of group activities using first-person vision.

I received my Ph.D. from Graduate School of Information Science and Technology at the [University of Tokyo](http://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), supervised by Prof. Yoichi Sato and co-advised by [Dr. Kris Kitani](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~kkitani/). I received my M.S. in Communication and Information Engineering and B.S. in Electronics and Information Engineering at [Northwestern Polytechnical University](http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/).
