We proposed a vision-based approach to automate grasp analysis for large amounts of video data. Discriminative classifiers were trained to recognize different grasp types based on computer vision techniques. Visual structures of hand grasps were learned by a supervised grasp clustering method. Our work shows the potential for using computer vision techniques for analyzing hand grasps with large scale of data in real-life settings.
