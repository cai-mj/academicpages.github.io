This work aims to develop a computer-vision technique for understanding objects jointly attended by a group of people during social interactions. As a key tool to dis- cover such objects of joint attention, we rely on a collec- tion of wearable eye-tracking cameras that provide a first- person video of interaction scenes and points-of-gaze data of interacting parties. Technically, we propose a hierarchi- cal conditional random field-based model that can 1) lo- calize events of joint attention temporally and 2) segment objects of joint attention spatially. We show that by alter- nating these two procedures, objects of joint attention can be discovered reliably even from cluttered scenes and noisy points-of-gaze data. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods for co-segmentation and joint attention discovery.
